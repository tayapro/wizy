    <!-- 10 incorrect guesses in hangman game -->
    <span>
      - Start the Game: Choose an online Hangman game and start a new round. The
      game will randomly select a word for you to guess, and you'll start with
      10 donuts. - Guess a Letter: Click or type a letter you think might be in
      the word. If your guess is correct, the game will reveal the letter in the
      blanks. - Lose a Donut for Wrong Guesses: If your guess is wrong, one
      donut disappears. Keep guessing letters! - Track Your Progress: Continue
      guessing letters to fill in the word. Each incorrect guess removes another
      donut. Win or Lose: If you guess the word before all 11 donuts disappear,
      you win! If all the donuts are gone before you guess the word, you lose.
      Try again and don't lose your donuts!
