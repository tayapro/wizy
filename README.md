# Purpose

Who wouldn't want to be on a sandy beach by the ocean when it's raining in Ireland in the middle of July?

The WIZY hangman web application is a classic word-guessing game with a sunny vacation theme. Guess a word, save as many lives as possible, and discover your destination. It could be a stroll in the nearest park, a quick weekend trip to see your grandma, or a long vacation on a beach by the ocean.

In this game, lives are represented by travel essentials such as sunglasses, a suitcase, a hat, a camera, etc. The words to guess are based on common themes and vary in difficulty levels.

The goals are to create a challenging and enjoyable experience with different difficulty levels, easy-to-use controls, and attractive animations. The main objective is to make learning new words fun and entertaining.

The WIZY web app is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript as a Portfolio Project#2 for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer(e-Commerce) course.

# Features

## Existing Features

### F01 Navigation Bar

Each page has a sticky navigation bar at the top that is fully responsive. It includes a logo linking to the Home page, as well as links to the Home, Champions pages. The navigation bar layout is consistent across all devices, making navigation simple and intuitive. The underline appears when you move the mouse over the menu links.

<img src="assets/images/readme/menu_desktop.png" width="400" alt="menu desktop image">

For mobile devices, it transforms into a compact "hamburger menu." This dropdown menu contains the same items, displayed in a column on a semitransparent background.

<img src="assets/images/readme/menu_mobile.png" width="400" alt="menu mobile image">

### F02 Home page - image and call to action

When you visit the WIZY website, you're greeted by a cheerful cartoon pineapple floating on an inflatable ring in a pool or the sea. His big sunglasses and laid-back pose show he's really having a great time on his vacation. This instantly sets a positive tone.

The playful pineapple, catchy tagline, and game invitation convey the website's overall fun and engaging theme.

  <img src="assets/images/readme/f04_mobile.png" width="150" alt="rules page mobile view image"/> 
</p>

### F05 Rules page - select form

The Rules page includes a user-friendly form where players can choose the game's difficulty level from a dropdown menu.

<img src="assets/images/readme/f05_mobile.png" width="300" alt="rules page select game level image"/>

The LocalStorage will store a **Complexity** record as a key and LEVEL number as value.

<img src="assets/images/readme/f05_local_storage.png" width="500" alt="complexity localStorage image"/>

Complexity levels mapping:

| Complexity's name    | number in WIZY system |
| :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| _Picnic in the Park_ | 0                     |
| _Campfire Tales_     | 1                     |
| _Sunny Beach_        | 2                     |

### F06 Rules page - user's icon

In the top right corner of the header, users can see their name's first letter displayed as an icon (this applies to all screen sizes).

<p float="left">
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f06_desktop.png" width="500" alt="user's icon on rules page desktop view image"/>
  <img src="assets/images/readme/f06_mobile.png" width="151" alt="user's icon on rules page mobile view image"/> 
</p>

The user's name is stored in localStorage, as explained in the _F03 Home page - input form_ section above. <br >
This information is used by a JavaScript function to read and update the DOM element on the Rules page.

### F07 Game page

### F08 Game page - lives blocks

# Design

## Imagery

## Colour Scheme

## Typography

For this project Rubik (logo) and Varela Round (body text) are used as fonts. <br>
Rubik font is great for a game app logo because its bold, modern design makes it stand out.<br>
Varela Round, with its friendly and rounded design, offers excellent readability and a warm,
approachable feel, making it a great choice for game apps.

# Project Structure (JS)

## Architecture

<table>
<tr>
   <td><img src="./assets/images/readme/architecture_fun.webp" alt="architecture fun image" width="400"></td>
   <td>Having a good architecture for a JavaScript project is crucial for several reasons:
      <ol>
         <li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: A well-structured project makes it easier to understand, 
            modify, and extend the codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.</li>
         <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: good architecture allows the project to scale and add 
            new features without becoming unwieldy or difficult to manage.</li>
         <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: clear separation of concerns and organized code facilitates 
            teamwork, enabling multiple developers to work on different project parts simultaneously 
            without conflicts.</li>
      </ol>
   </td>

### Project Architecture Overview

The WIZY project architecture is organized into three levels:

<img src="./assets/images/readme/architecture_project.webp" alt="project architecture image" width="900">

1. **Main Level**: This level consists of the main.js file, which serves as a router to dynamically load the content of all other pages.

2. **Pages Level**: This level comprises JavaScript files for individual pages, such as the landing page, rules page, and game page. Each file contains the specific content and functionality for its corresponding page.
   There are no horizontal dependencies at this levels. The pages js files depend only on components js files.

3. **Components Level**: This level consists of component JavaScript files. These components act as building blocks that are utilized by the page-level JavaScript files to construct the overall page logic and functionality.
   There are no horizontal dependencies at this level. The component js files depend only on library `animate.js` file.

4. **Libraries**: This section contains project-wide libraries used as external dependencies, with the potential to be released as npm packages. It currently includes an animation library that provides animation capabilities for HTML elements.

## JavaScript Structure

1. On the **Main Level**, there is a `main.js` file that imports all the pages JavaScript files such as:

   - `champions-page.js`
   - `game-page.js`
   - `landing-page.js`
   - `outcome-page.js`
   - `rules-page.js`

   Inside the `main.js` file, there is an handler function attached to the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener, which includes a `try...catch` statement to handle any internal errors.

   In case of an error, the user will be redirected to the `500.html` page.

> [!NOTE]
> Use `if...else if` instead of `switch...case` to avoid creating additional functions for parsing URLs.

2. **Pages Level**

   2.1. `champions-page.js` file is responsible for Champions page view with actual list of game leaders.
   Sets the default list of champions if no champion data exists in local storage.

3. **Component Level**

**Library** `animate.js` file

> [!NOTE]
> The files have quite detailed comments for more in-depth information.

## Main JS features

- _Dispatcher event handler function_, where using the corresponding onloading page js functions redirect to to the required HTML page based on the URL.
- The WIZY application utilizes `throw new Error` statement for error handling to gracefully manage unexpected conditions and provide informative feedback, contributing to a more reliable and user-friendly experience.
- WIZY app is a project without server-side storage and _use localStorage to store pairs: key and value_.
  LocalStorage enables data to persist across page reloads and sessions. It offers a simple and efficient method for storing user preferences, game scores, or settings directly in the user's browser.

  - **Username** localStorage record has `{Username: NAME}` format, where `NAME` is a string with 2 to 10 characters.
    The username will be changed to a new one every time, then they fill the username and click `Play` button
    on the landing WIZY page.

  - **Complexity** localStorage record has `{Complexity: NUMBER}` format, where `NUMBER` is a integer between 0 and 2.
    0 is easy level, 1 is middle complexity level, 2 is hard level.
    The selected complexity level on `Rules` page is saved on localStorage and displayed on the game's outcome page as current level for new game. <br >
    If the user wants to play a new game at the same level, they can do so, just click `Play` button.
    Alternatively, users can change the complexity and click the `Play` button to start a new game at the
    chosen level of complexity on the game's outcome page.

  - **Champions** localStorage record has `Champions` as key and array of 5 objects with following structure:
    `{name: USERNAME, score: SCORE_NUMBER, timeStamp: TIMESTAMP_NUMBER}` as value, where `USERNAME` is string, `SCORE_NUMBER` is total score number less 1000, `TIMESTAMP_NUMBER` - Unix epoch time. <br >
    The initial champions list is read and downloaded from the `champions` array in `champions.js` file. If a user achieves a score better than the minimum score in this list, they will be added to the champions list. The list will be updated
    (contains the 5 best players). A user can have a few records in the list of champions. <br >
    If a user refreshes the outcome page of the game multiple times, the champions page will not display any duplicates (the localStorage will also not contain duplicates).

> [!NOTE]
> There is no need to clean up localStorage before writing data because it will overwrite the `Username` and `Complexity` records. The `Champions` record will be updated based on a user's scores.
